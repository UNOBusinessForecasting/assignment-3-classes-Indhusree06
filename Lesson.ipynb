        "\n",
        "**Classes** are a critical element of object-oriented programming. Basically everything that you work with in Python belongs to a class. A class is **type** of object that we are working with. In order to work with numbers, we have to understand that they have specific functionality. You might remember from week 1 when we introduced the basic types of information in Python that we talked about the different functions available to us with numbers, strings, or any other type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hidden in the background of this conversation was the fact that Python has a defined understanding of numbers, for example. Each number that we can work with belongs to a **class** of objects (either `int` or `float`) that defines the way that numbers are supposed to work. Information about the data contained by that specific number object and functions that apply specifically to that object are associated with the object through its **class inheritance**. This inheritance allows one class to build off of another, and we will see this in action throughout this course.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the single greatest advantage a class provides is to allow us to generate multiple related objects, and to manipulate them quickly and efficiently. Let's start making classes to understand a bit more\n"

These arguments always begin with `self`. `self` is the argument that tells our function that it is attached to a class, and that it should ensure that it has access to that class. In short, we are giving our function permission to modify our object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any other arguments are provided after self, and can bring useful information for describing a specific instance of the class. In our case these are `owner` and `bread`, so that we can indicate who owns the sandwich and what kind of bread it was made on. We can also see that `bread` has a default argument: `bread='white'` tells Python that the default bread type is `white`, and that if the user does not specify a type of bread, we can work with `white` bread in this instance. No default is provided for `owner`, though. The user MUST specify the owner, or encounter an error.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inside of the `__init__` function, we assign arguments to **attributes** using the `.` syntax. We are creating information that is tied to our class instance. For example, each sandwich instance will have an attribute `.owner`, which will contain information about who the owner of the sandwich is, as well as a `.bread` attribute taking in information about which bread was used. We can also create other attributes. In this case, we create a `.toppings` attribute associated with an empty list that will be filled in as we add toppings to the sandwich.\n",
